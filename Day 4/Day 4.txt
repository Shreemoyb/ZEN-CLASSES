1. How to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?
   a. let obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
   b. let obj2 = { age:5, name: " Person 1"};

2. Use the rest countries' API URL -> https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all and display all the country flags in the console.

3. Use the same rest countries and print all countries names, regions, sub-region and populations.
